Unreleased
----------

* Validate staged ``backend_kws`` by backend and operation, with typo
  suggestions and documented value constraints.
* Document all SciPy, dense, Fortran, and PETSc staged-backend options.  The
  staged Fortran and PETSc RIXS interfaces use ``linsys_maxiter``; legacy
  Fortran function signatures are unchanged.

This page summarizes the user-visible changes in each tagged release.  See the
