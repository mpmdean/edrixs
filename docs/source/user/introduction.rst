Introduction to EDRIXS
**********************

EDRIXS computes X-ray absorption (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
(RIXS) spectra by exact diagonalization (ED) of model Hamiltonians for
correlated electrons.

Every calculation follows the same path, with the following four stages:

* Defining the **physical model** -- constructing the single-particle matrices
  of the Hamiltonian, the Fock basis, and the transition operators for the
  excitations.
* Building the **many-body operators** -- expressing those Hamiltonians and
  transition operators in the full Fock basis.
* Using **exact diagonalization** to obtain the low-energy eigenvalues and
  eigenstates of the Hamiltonians.
* Constructing the **spectrum** from the transition operators, eigenvalues and
  eigenvectors.

Each stage is a thin layer of functions that can accommodate different
backends.  We review each of them with the help of the flow chart below.

   The stages of an EDRIXS calculation.  The quantities passed from one stage
   to the next are shown in gray to the right of the arrows.

The sections below follow the figure box by box.  The :ref:`backend` that
carries out the linear algebra for the last three stages is described on its
own page.  The units, naming, orbital orderings, single-particle bases,
Fock-basis encoding and spectral conventions are collected separately on the
:ref:`conventions` page, and the :ref:`pedagogical examples <examples>` work
through the same material in more physical detail.

.. _physical-model:

The physical model
==================

There are (so far) three ``edrixs.models`` constructors:

* :func:`~edrixs.models.model_1v1c` -- one valence shell and one core shell
  (for example, Cu :math:`3d` and :math:`2p`).
* :func:`~edrixs.models.model_2v1c` -- two valence shells and one core shell.
* :func:`~edrixs.models.model_siam` -- an Anderson impurity model.

Each returns a description of the problem, building no operators itself:

* the one-body matrices ``emat_i`` / ``emat_n``,
* the Coulomb tensors ``umat_i`` / ``umat_n``,
* compact Fock-basis specifications ``basis_i`` / ``basis_n``, and
* the Cartesian photon transition matrices ``trans_mat``.

The ``_i`` suffix marks the initial and final states, which have no core hole,
and ``_n`` the intermediate state, which has one.

``emat`` and ``umat`` are the coefficients of a second-quantized Hamiltonian

.. math::

   \hat{H} = \sum_{ij} t_{ij}\, \hat{f}_i^{\dagger} \hat{f}_j
           + \sum_{ijlk} U_{ijlk}\, \hat{f}_i^{\dagger} \hat{f}_j^{\dagger}
             \hat{f}_k \hat{f}_l ,

with the one-body coefficients :math:`t_{ij}` passed as ``emat`` and the
two-body coefficients :math:`U_{ijkl}` as ``umat``.  Their single-particle
index runs over spin-orbitals in the default basis and orbital order set out in
:ref:`conventions`, where the units and the naming of these quantities are also
collected.

``emat`` carries all of the one-body physics, and the separate contributions
simply add together:

* the **on-site orbital energies**, including any crystal-field splitting,
* the **spin-orbit coupling** of the valence and core shells,
* the **hopping and hybridization** between sites, or between an impurity and
  its bath, and
* **external field** terms, such as the Zeeman coupling to an applied magnetic
  field.

Because they are additive, a crystal-field, hopping or Zeeman matrix that you
construct yourself is simply added into ``emat`` -- after transforming it into
the default single-particle basis if it is not already expressed there.

``umat`` carries the two-body Coulomb interaction.  It is parameterized by
Slater integrals :math:`F^k`, with :math:`G^k` for the core-valence terms.
EDRIXS ships Hartree-Fock values in :func:`~edrixs.utils.get_atom_data` and
provides conversions between the common parameterizations, such as
:func:`~edrixs.utils.UdJH_to_F0F2F4`.

.. _many-body-operators:

Many-body operators
===================

The second stage picks the many-body Fock basis :math:`\lvert \Phi \rangle`
defined above and evaluates the Hamiltonian in it.

:func:`~edrixs.solvers.build_op` builds one many-body operator:

* ``emat``, ``umat`` -- the one- and two-body coefficients from the first
  stage.  Pass ``None`` for whichever of the two is absent.
* ``basis`` -- a Fock-basis specification, or a realized basis.
* ``backend`` -- the representation the operator is returned in.

It returns the matrix :math:`\langle \Phi_l \rvert \hat{H} \lvert \Phi_r
\rangle` of the one- and two-body terms above.

:func:`~edrixs.solvers.get_ops` is the spectroscopy-oriented wrapper, which
builds everything a XAS or RIXS calculation needs in one call:

* ``emat_i``, ``umat_i``, ``basis_i`` and their ``_n`` counterparts -- the two
  Fock spaces, without and with a core hole.
* ``trans_mat`` -- the Cartesian photon transition matrices from the model.

It returns ``hmat_i``, ``hmat_n`` and the many-body transition operators
``trans_ops``.  Because XAS and RIXS connect states with no core hole to states
with exactly one core hole, keeping the two Hamiltonians separate is what makes
the calculation efficient.

The Fock-basis encoding and the valence-before-core orbital ordering that both
functions assume are set out in :ref:`conventions`.

.. _exact-diagonalization:

Exact diagonalization
=====================

The third stage finds the low-energy eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian.

:func:`~edrixs.solvers.ed` diagonalizes a many-body Hamiltonian and returns its
``num_evals`` lowest eigenpairs as ``eval_i``, ``evec_i``:

* ``eval_i`` is a 1D real array ordered by increasing energy.
* For the ``dense`` and ``scipy`` backends ``evec_i`` is a 2D complex array; the
  eigenvector belonging to ``eval_i[k]`` is the column ``evec_i[:, k]``.  For
  the ``petsc`` backend ``evec_i`` is a list of distributed PETSc vectors.

.. _xas:

XAS
===
:func:`~edrixs.solvers.xas` provides spectra as a function of the incident photon energy
``ominc`` and returns an array of shape
``(len(ominc), len(pol_type))``.  Its main arguments are ``gamma_c``,
the inverse core-hole lifetime; ``pol_type``, a list of ``(kind, angle)``
polarization channels; the incident-beam angle ``thin`` and azimuth ``phi``;
and ``temperature``, which sets Boltzmann weights over the retained initial
states (so ``num_evals`` in ``ed`` must cover every thermally populated one).
The geometry and polarization conventions are on the :ref:`conventions` page.

.. _rixs:

RIXS
====

RIXS reuses ``eval_i``, ``evec_i``, ``hmat_i``, ``hmat_n`` and ``trans_ops``
from the XAS setup unchanged.  In addition to ``ominc`` you supply the
energy-loss grid ``eloss``, the emitted-beam angle ``thout``, the final-state /
resolution width ``gamma_f``, and 4-tuple
``(in_kind, in_angle, out_kind, out_angle)`` polarization channels.
:func:`~edrixs.solvers.rixs` returns an array of shape
``(len(ominc), len(eloss), len(pol_type))``.  It is very common to compute two
different emitted polarizations and sum them, since this is what happens for
RIXS with no scattered-polarization analysis.

See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_example_02_single_atom_RIXS.py` for a full
worked calculation of the 
:func:`~edrixs.models.model_1v1c` model including plotting the
incident-energy / energy-loss map. Other models have more parameters
to pay attention to but are, in most ways, not fundamentally more complicated.
