Installation
************
For Linux users we suggest :ref:`installing with anaconda <AnacondaInstall>`. For Windows and macOS machines, we suggest using the :ref:`docker instructions <edrixsanddocker>`, which are relatively straightforward.  In principle, you can also compile the code from the source for Linux, but this is quite involved and we recommend against this for standard use.


.. _AnacondaInstall:

Install and use EDRIXS via Anaconda
====================================================
A conda package has been built for Linux. To use EDRIXS via Anaconda, you need first to install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ in your system.
We recommend installing EDRIXS into a separate environment, for example, called ``edrixs_env``, together with any other packages you might want to use like this::

    conda create --name edrixs_env -c conda-forge python=3.13 edrixs matplotlib

We endeavor to keep the conda-forge release up to date, but note that these builds will usually not correspond to the latest version of EDRIXS, which is available in the `master branch of EDRIXS <https://github.com/NSLS-II/edrixs>`_.

EDRIXS will also run on `Google Colaboratory <https://research.google.com/colaboratory/>`_, but does not come installed as default. Installing it requires a you to install conda and then EDRIXS, which can be done by executing a cell::

    !pip install -q condacolab
    import condacolab
    condacolab.install()
    !conda install -c conda-forge edrixs

from within a notebook cell.

Requirements
============
Several tools and libraries are required to build and install EDRIXS,

   * Fortran compiler: gfortran and ifort are supported
   * MPI environment: openmpi and mpich are tested
   * MPI Fortran and C compilers: mpif90, mpicc
   * BLAS and LAPACK libraries: `OpenBLAS <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/>`_ with gfortran and MKL with ifort
   * ARPACK library: `arpack-ng <https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng/>`_  with mpi enabled
   * Only Python3 is supported
   * numpy, scipy, sympy, matplotlib, sphinx, numpydoc
   * mpi4py with the same MPI implementation libraries (``openmpi`` or ``mpich``) as building EDRIXS

Build from source
=================
We will show how to build EDRIXS from source on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.
We will use gcc, gfortran, openmpi and OpenBLAS in these examples.
Building EDRIXS on other versions of Linux or with Intel's ifort+MKL will be similar.

Ubuntu Linux 20.04
------------------
Install compilers and tools::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran gcc
    sudo apt-get install git wget
    sudo apt-get install python3 libpython3-dev python3-pip python3-venv

Create and activate a python virtual environment for EDRIXS::

    python3 -m venv VIRTUAL_ENV
    source VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate

where ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` should be replaced by the directory where you wish to install EDRIXS.

Alternatively create and activate a conda environment for EDRIXS::

    conda create --name edrixs_env python=3.10
    conda activate edrixs_env

We will assume ``python`` and ``pip`` are pointing to the activated environment from now on.
Check we are using the expected python and pip::

    which python
    which pip
    python --version

Fetch the latest version of ``pip``::

    pip install --upgrade pip

openmpi, OpenBLAS, ARPACK can be installed by ``apt-get``, but their versions are old and may not work properly.
However, they can also be compiled from source easily. In the following, we will show both ways, but we always recommend to build newer ones from source.

openmpi can be installed by::

    sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev

or from newer version of source, for example v3.1.4::

    wget https://download.open-mpi.org/release/open-mpi/v3.1/openmpi-3.1.4.tar.bz2
    tar -xjf openmpi-3.1.4.tar.bz2
    cd openmpi-3.1.4
    ./configure CC=gcc CXX=g++ FC=gfortran
    make
    sudo make install

the compiling process will take a while.

OpenBLAS can be installed by::

    sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev

or from a newer version of source::

    wget https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/archive/v0.3.6.tar.gz
    tar -xzf v0.3.6.tar.gz
    cd OpenBLAS-0.3.6
    make CC=gcc FC=gfortran
    sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install

ARPACK can be installed by::

    sudo apt-get install libarpack2-dev libparpack2-dev

or from a newer version of source::

    wget https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng/archive/3.6.3.tar.gz
    tar -xzf 3.6.3.tar.gz
    cd arpack-ng-3.6.3
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --enable-mpi --with-blas="-L/usr/local/lib/ -lopenblas" FC=gfortran F77=gfortran MPIFC=mpif90 MPIF77=mpif90
    make
    sudo make install

mpi4py can be installed by::

    export MPICC=/usr/local/bin/mpicc
    sudo pip install --no-cache-dir mpi4py

or from source::

    wget https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py/archive/3.0.1.tar.gz
    tar xzf 3.0.1.tar.gz
    cd mpi4py-3.0.1

edit mpi.cfg to set MPI paths as following::

    [mpi]
    mpi_dir              = /usr/local
    mpicc                = %(mpi_dir)s/bin/mpicc
    mpicxx               = %(mpi_dir)s/bin/mpicxx
    include_dirs         = %(mpi_dir)s/include
    libraries            = mpi
    library_dirs         = %(mpi_dir)s/lib
    runtime_library_dirs = %(mpi_dir)s/lib

and comment all other contents. Then, build and install by::

    python setup.py build
    sudo pip install .

Check whether the MPI paths are correct by::

    python
    >>> import mpi4py
    >>> mpi4py.get_config()
    {'mpicc': '/usr/local/bin/mpicc',
     'mpicxx': '/usr/local/bin/mpicxx',
     'include_dirs': '/usr/local/include',
     'libraries': 'mpi',
     'library_dirs': '/usr/local/lib',
     'runtime_library_dirs': '/usr/local/lib'}

Now, we are ready to build EDRIXS::

    git clone https://github.com/NSLS-II/edrixs.git
    cd edrixs
    pip install -v .

Start to play with EDRIXS by::

    python
    >>> import edrixs
    >>> edrixs.some_functions(...)

or go to ``examples`` directory to run some examples::

    cd examples/more/ED/14orb
    ./get_inputs.py
    mpirun -np 2 ed.x
    mpirun -np 2 ./run_fedsolver.py
    cd ../../RIXS/LaNiO3_thin
    mpirun -np 2 ./run_rixs_fsolver.py

if no errors, the installation is successful.
