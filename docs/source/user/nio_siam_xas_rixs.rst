*******************************************
NiO Anderson impurity model XAS and RIXS
*******************************************

This example uses :func:`~edrixs.models.model_siam` to calculate Ni
:math:`L_{2,3}`-edge XAS and RIXS for a NiO Anderson impurity model. The model
contains a correlated Ni :math:`3d` shell and one bath site representing ten
symmetry-adapted O :math:`2p` ligand spin-orbitals. Hybridization allows the
calculation to include ligand-to-metal charge-transfer configurations.
The distributed PETSc/SLEPc backend is used for the many-body operators and
solvers. The example runs on one process during the documentation build, or it
can be run in parallel with ``mpirun``.
